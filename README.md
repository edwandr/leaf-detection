# leaf-detection
#### Work for a 3rd year project in Deep Learning Unit

`feature_detection.py` is used to extract features from each leaf image in `input/images`

* Two methodes can be used, SIFT or ORB
* These features and labels are stored in `input/train-orb.csv` and `input/train-sift.csv`
* `input/train-kaggle.csv` contains features given on Kaggle Challenge



`leaf-classifier_NN_2.py` contains our MLP Classifier
